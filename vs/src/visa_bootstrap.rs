//! Bootstrap visas: the visas that let a node reach VSAPI *before* it has connected.
//!
//! A node declared in policy as a peer of an already-connected node has no actor and no route
//! until its link comes up, and the way it brings that link up is by reaching the visa service
//! over VSAPI. Policy evaluation cannot answer for it, so these visas are minted directly from
//! the policy-declared peering, which *is* the authorization.
//!
//! There are two ways a bootstrap visa gets to where it is needed, and both live here:
//! - [visas_for_link] mints the peer's own visas for a topology send, which carries them to the
//!   peer's neighbour inside `Link.visas` for hand-off when the peer shows up. These have to be
//!   pushed: the peer cannot ask for a visa until it has a VSAPI session, and these are what let
//!   it open one.
//! - [visa_for_future_peer_request] answers a *connected* node that saw the peer's traffic --
//!   the SYN it relays, or the visa service's reply to it -- before its own queued copy landed.
//!
//! Each direction of the session is its own visa -- see
//! `VisaMgr::vsapi_bootstrap_visa_for_future_peer`, which does the actual minting and stays in
//! [crate::visa_mgr] because it needs the visa store's internals.
//!
//! There is also support code in [crate::vss_worker] used when we send the set_topology message.
//!
//! TODO: This whole module is a HACK to get initial MULTINODE working, and is meant to be
//! deleted once peers authenticate and route properly before needing VSAPI.
//!
//! See: https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-visaservice/issues/301
